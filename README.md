# Fine-Tune-Vision-Transformer-Model
This repository contains code  for fine-tuning a Swin Transformer model on a multilabel image classification dataset. The implementation is built using PyTorch and leverages the Hugging Face transformers library, along with accelerate for distributed training. The dataset consists of images with multiple labels (20 classes), and the model is evaluated using the ROC-AUC metric. The training process fine-tunes the entire model without parameter-efficient techniques like LoRA.
